Abstract ΓÇöMobile service continuity is essential important
to ensure that user sessions and services will survive usermobility. The 5G enhances its mobility management by providingthe ∩¼éexibility and offering three types of Session and ServiceContinuity (SSC) modes to address various service continuityrequirements. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a typeof widely adopted network architecture that delivers networkservices from the boundary of the mobile network by provisioninga set of edge servers. Determining an optimum planning ofMEC edge servers, which involves determining edge serversappropriate geographical positions and their serving areas, is aprecondition for more ef∩¼ücient service provisioning and better
usage of network resources. In this work, we investigate the
MEC servers planning problem by considering the managementcost for maintaining MEC service continuity. The problem isformulated as a graph partitioning problem to partition the RANgraph with minimum SSC management costs and balanced MECservers workloads. Then, we adapt a generalizable approximateGraph Partitioning framework which leverages on Graph NeuralNetwork (GNN) to embed the RAN network spacial featureand on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for graph partitioning.Based on the framework, we propose a MEC server planningalgorithm named MECP-GAP. Finally, we evaluate MECP-GAPwith extensive simulations and real network data. Comparing toseveral baselines, MECP-GAP achieves better performance withlower running time.

Digital Object Identi∩¼üer 10.1109/TNSM.2024.3412959an increasingly important role in the ∩¼üeld of daily life and
industrial production. Since the ∩¼ürst-generation (1G) mobile
network, mobile networking has evolved signi∩¼ücantly and each
generation represents signi∩¼ücant technological improvements.For each generation of mobile network, mobility management
is one of the fundamental functionalities that enables effective
services delivers and maintains connections towards mobileusers on the move [1]. The 3GPP 5G network also supports
the mobility management functions with enhancements in user
state management, handover and cell reselection, and Sessionand Service Continuity (SSC) [2]. The mobile data service
is the fundamental service type in the 5G, hence service
continuity has attracted more concern to ensure that user
sessions will survive movements, and the 5G provides the
∩¼éexibility by offering three types of SSC modes to addressvarious service continuity requirements.
Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a type of network
architecture that delivers network services from the boundaryof the mobile network by provisioning a set of geographically
distributed edge servers at the edge of the network. MEC
has been widely adopted to enhance the performance ofvarious network services, such as mobile content delivery [3],
smart city [4], Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications [5],
etc. For deploying an MEC system, determining an optimumplanning of MEC edge servers is a fundamental precondition
for more ef∩¼ücient service provisioning and better usage of
network resources [6]. The planning of MEC edge servers
refers to the determination of (1) the optimal locations for
MEC edge servers, and (2) the appropriate MEC edge servers
serving areas, which has attracted wide attention in recent
years. These two problems are tightly coupled, and the serving
area determination is essential, based on which the locationdetermination problem can be reduced into ∩¼ünding the centroid
within the serving area.
In[7], the authors introduce a framework to jointly optimize
the placement of MEC servers and User Plane Functions
(UPF) in a dynamic network environment. They formulate
the problem as Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and utilizea scheduling technique based on Optimal Stopping Theory
(OST) to decide the optimal recon∩¼üguration time. In [8],
the authors jointly consider edge server deployment andservice placement to maximize the overall pro∩¼üt of the MEC
system. They propose a two-step method including a clustering
algorithm and nonlinear programming to solve the formulatedproblem. In [6], the authors formulate the MEC edge servers
placement problem with dynamic uncertain resource demands

through an uncertain programming formulation, and a deep-
learning based algorithm is proposed to practically solve theproblem. In [9], the authors formulate the edge server place-
ment problem as a capacitated location allocation problem
and provide an algorithm for effective solutions. In [10],
the authors study the MEC server placement in smart cities.
They formulate the problem as a multi-objective constraint
optimization problem and adopt mixed integer programmingto ∩¼ünd the optimal solution.
However, MEC edge servers are provisioned to provide
network services, and none of the above works consider theoptimization of MEC servers planning in terms of minimizing
the management costs in providing service continuity for
moving users. Moreover, existing works are based on tradi-
tional model-based methods which formulate and solve the
MEC server planning problem as an optimization problem.With the development of Arti∩¼ücial Intelligence (AI) tech-
nology, machine learning-based methods are widely applied
in various domains, including network optimization [11].
Comparing to the traditional model-based optimization meth-
ods, machine learning are model-free and data-driven, which
could explore the intrinsic inner relationships between com-plex system parameters and possible to discover better
solutions. Hence, in this current work, we aim to investigate
the MEC servers planning problem by considering the man-agement cost for maintaining MEC service continuity with
machine learning-based methods . Speci∩¼ücally, we focus on the
MEC edge server serving area determination problem. Becauseupon the determined serving area of each MEC server, the
optimal location can be further decided trivially by ∩¼ünding the
centroid within the serving area.
By considering the underlying Radio Access Network
(RAN) in a certain region as a graph, the MEC servers plan-ning problem is formulated as a graph partitioning problem
such that node weights represent Base Stations (BSs) average
workloads and edge weights represent users handover man-agement costs in service data delivery. Hence, partitioning the
RAN graph with minimum edge cuts and balanced cluster
node weights refers to the optimum MEC servers planningwith minimum SSC management costs and balanced MEC
servers workloads. To solve this formulated problem, we adapt
a generalizable approximate Graph Partitioning frameworkproposed in [12] which leverages on Graph Neural Network
(GNN) to embed the RAN network spacial features and on
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for graph partitioning. We de∩¼ünethe loss function to generate partitions with balanced node
weight and minimum edge cut. Based on this generalizable
approximate partitioning (GAP) framework, we design anMEC server Planning algorithm, named as MECP-GAP, to
determine the optimum MEC servers planning from an input
RAN and users movements to minimize SSC management
costs with balanced MEC servers workloads. Moreover, the
framework is generalizable, once trained it can produce ef∩¼ü-cient partitions results on unseen graphs at inference time.
Finally, we evaluate MECP-GAP with extensive simulations
and real network data. Comparing to two traditional algorithmsfor graph partitioning problem, MECP-GAP achieves better
performance with lower running time. Our contributions are
summarized as follows:ΓÇóFirstly, we investigate the MEC servers planning problemto minimize the management cost for maintaining servicecontinuity for moving users. We formulate this problem
as a graph partitioning problem with minimum edge cuts
and balanced cluster node weights.
ΓÇóThen, we adapt a learning-based framework to solve
the above problem. By integrating GNN and MLP, the
framework is generalizable for producing solutions forvarious types of unseen graphs at inference time. This is
an advantage over the traditional model-based methods
which must reperform the optimization problem for everynew use case.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Related works
are summarized in Section II. Then, Section IIIformulates
the problem of mobility-aware MEC planning through graph
partitioning. Then, we detail the MECP-GAP algorithm inSection IV. In Section V, we evaluate the performance gain of
MECP-GAP over several baselines. Finally, we conclude this

ELATED WORKS
A. Mobility Management
Mobile network planning optimization with respect to
mobility management is an important issue and has beenintensively studied in the literature. From the GSM system, a
group of cells is called Location Area (LA) to facilitate paging.
The planning of LAs aims to balance the tradeoff betweentwo con∩¼éicting metrics: the amount of paging messages and
registration signalling. In [13], the authors design the layout
of LAs to balance this tradeoff for the GSM system. From
the LTE system, Tracking Area (TA) is utilized to group cells
and to locate mobile devices. In [14], the authors determine
the TAs for the LTE network by applying multi-objective
optimization for achieving a balanced tradeoff between pag-
ing overhead and tracking area update, and they design anevolutionary multi-objective algorithm based on a population
decomposition strategy. In [15], the authors propose an TA list
management framework to format the optimal TA distributionin the form of TA lists and determine the association from
TA lists towards mobile devices for the 5G system. Besides,
data delivery is now the fundamental service types in mobilenetwork, and service continuity is essential important to ensure
that user sessions and services will survive user mobility.
In view of this, 5G enhances its mobility management byproviding three types of SSC modes to address various service
continuity requirements. In [16], the authors analyze mobility-
aware cellular network performance with several mobilitypatterns and network topologies. They also point out that
mobility would impact on service delivery and outline the
challenges for mobility-aware analysis. Hence, the 5G network
planning optimization should also consider to optimize the
structure and layout of the network for minimizing themanagement cost in maintaining service continuity. In this
work, we aim to study the MEC servers planning problem by
optimizing the management cost for maintaining MEC servicecontinuity.
In[17], the authors consider the issue of managing high-
speed mobility in 5G networks. To solve this problem,

the authors propose an online learn-based mechanism that
uses Kalman ∩¼ülters to compute the posterior value ofthe RSRP values of service units and adjacent units to
determine the best target unit for switching, so as to
maintain high performance under extremely high mobilityafter migration. Simulations show that this mechanism can
signi∩¼ücantly improve handover execution in 5G, enabling
intelligent handling of high-speed mobile management in 5Gand beyond. In [18], a novel two-layer cooperative satellite
network architecture is proposed. Based on the proposed two-
layer cooperative satellite network architecture, four mobilitymanagement scenarios in satellite-ground communication sce-
narios are studied. For each scenario, the corresponding
switching mode is proposed to ensure the continuity of
terminal services, and the corresponding signaling overhead is
analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed switchingmode can greatly reduce the signaling overhead. In [19],t h e
authors examine the challenges facing emerging and future
cellular Networks such as Ultra-Dense Multi-Band Networks(UDMNs), including Resource-Inef∩¼üciency and Scarcity, User-
Experience Degradation and Unprecedented Channel Behavior
in mmWave Cells. The author proposes an Advanced MobilityManagement and Utilization based on machine-learning-based
mobility and traf∩¼üc prediction models Framework. The frame-
work is capable of predicting mobility patterns, next candidatecells for handover, and handover time, as well as future cell
loads.
B. MEC Planning
Determining an optimum planning of MEC edge servers
is a fundamental precondition for deploying an MEC system,
which has attracted wide attention in recent years. Mostexisting works are traditional model-based methods which
formulate the MEC planning problem as an optimization
problem. Due to the complexity of the problem, heuristicalgorithms are normally proposed. In [7], the authors jointly
optimize the placement of MEC servers and UPF through
ILP in a dynamic network environment. In [8], the authors
jointly consider edge server deployment and service placement
to maximize the overall pro∩¼üt of the MEC system. They
propose a two-step method including a clustering algorithmand nonlinear programming to solve the formulated problem.
In[6], the authors formulate the MEC edge servers placement
problem with dynamic uncertain resource demands throughan uncertain programming formulation, and a learning based
algorithm is proposed to practically solve the problem. In
their algorithm, meta-heuristic is utilized to explore the solu-tion space, with MLP utilized to perform a fast prediction
for the ∩¼ütness function. In [9], the authors formulate the
edge server placement problem as a capacitated location
allocation problem and provide an heuristic algorithm for
effective solutions. In [10], the authors study the MEC server
placement in smart cities. They formulate the problem as
a multi-objective constraint optimization problem and adopt
mixed integer programming to ∩¼ünd the optimal solution. Formobility-aware MEC network resource allocation, in [20],
the authors study the edge server user association problemin dynamic environment where edge user high mobility is
considered. The problem is formulated as an online decision-making and evolvable process for allocating users at real-time.
In[21], the authors propose a mobility-aware task of∩¼éoading
scheme for vehicular MEC network, and they develop a DeepReinforcement Learning (DRL)-based algorithm to train the
of∩¼éoading strategy.
C. Graph Partitioning Problem
We formulate the MEC planning problem as a graph
partitioning problem, where BS nodes are partitioned into
clusters and each cluster is served by one MEC server. The
graph partitioning problem has been extensively studied in
the literature. Hence, we also survey related works in this
topic. Graph partitioning is the problem of dividing the nodesof a graph into balanced partitions while minimizing the
edge cut across the partitions. Graph partitioning is a well
studied optimization problem and has a wide application invarious domains. Traditional well-known algorithms include
the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm, the Kernighan-Lin
(KL) algorithm, the spectral method based on eigen-vectordecomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix. From the above
methods, the METIS algorithm [22] works very well in prac-
tice and is largely adopted. Moreover, with the developmentof the AI technology, there are also works that investi-
gate solving the graph partitioning problem through machine
learning-based methods. In [23], by combining the simulated-
annealing algorithm and the Hop∩¼üeld neural network, the
authors ∩¼ürst propose an learning based algorithm for solving
the graph partitioning problem. In [12], the authors propose
a Generalizable Approximate Partitioning framework, named
as the GAP framework. The framework contains two parts: agraph embedding part that leverages on Graph Neural Network
(GNN) to embed the graph spacial feature; and a graph parti-
tioning part that leverages on Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) forgraph partitioning. In [24], a theoretical performance analysis
of the GNN is presented. A mean-∩¼üeld theory of a minimal
GNN architecture is developed for the graph partitioningproblem. Numerical experiment results shows GNNΓÇÖs accuracy
in performing classi∩¼ücation tasks.
D. Graph Neural Network
Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a set of deep learning
methods that treat graph structured data in non-Euclidean
space. GNN has been intensively studied and applied inmultiple domains including: combinatorial optimization [12],
computer vision [25], and network management [26].T h e
idea of GNN was ∩¼ürst introduced in [27], the authors extend
existing neural network methods for processing data repre-
sented in graphical form. The general idea of GNN is to learn
a state embedding by exploring topological structure of thegraph and aggregating information from the neighbors of each
node. This embedding is then further utilized for downstream
tasks, such as graph-level, node-level or edge level tasks.There are several types of GNNs. The Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCNs) [28] utilize the convolution operation as

de∩¼üned in the Fourier domain by computing the eigen decom-
position of the graph Laplacian. The Message Passing NeuralNetworks (MPNNs) consists of message, update, and readout
functions which operate on nodes and edges in the graph [29].
The Graph Attention Networks (GAT) applies the attentionmechanism to aggregate information from node neighbors
through a weighted sum [30]. The GAP framework [12] is
designed to solve graph partitioning problem by using graphembedding and optimizing the partitioning loss function. In
this work, we leverage on GAP to solve the mobility-aware
MEC planning problem, which is formulated as a graphpartitioning problem. We design the input and the loss function
to adjust the algorithm into our case. Simulation results shows
that our improved framework and algorithm achieves betterplanning result with lower running time by comparing to
several traditional baselines.
III. S
YSTEM MODEL
In this section, we formulate the mobility-aware MEC
edge servers planning problem, which takes into account the
management cost for SSC continuity. The handover cost ofusers is formulated based on 3GPP technical speci∩¼ücations.
Finally, the problem is formulated as a graph-partitioning
problem with minimum edge cut and balanced node weight.
A. Problem Description
An overview of the 5G MEC data network and the cor-
responding MEC planning is shown in Fig. 1. Three MEC
servers are deployed to serve mobile users from multiple
gNBs. Each MEC server is equipped with resources to serveusers from several certain gNBs, and these gNBs are the
serving area of the MEC server. By applying the Uplink
Classi∩¼üer (UL CL) technology and con∩¼üguring UPFs, traf∩¼üc
from these gNBs can be directed to their serving MEC servers.
In the case of PDU Sessions of type IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6or Ethernet, the SMF may decide to insert in the data path
of a PDU Session an ΓÇ£UL CLΓÇ¥ (Uplink classi∩¼üer). The UL
CL is a functionality supported by an UPF that aims atdiverting (locally) some traf∩¼üc matching traf∩¼üc ∩¼ülters provided
by the SMF [2]. The insertion and removal of an UL CL isFig. 2. SSC mode 1 handover procedure between gNBs.
decided by the SMF and controlled by the SMF using generic
N4 and UPF capabilities. The UL CL can be con∩¼üguredwith the traf∩¼üc rules to forward the uplink traf∩¼üc towards
different targeted applications and network functions, and in
the downlink direction it will merge the traf∩¼üc destined to theUEs [31].
Mobile users are free to move, consequently, handovers
can happen in different levels: gNBs level and MEC serverslevel. For a moving user, when she crosses the boundaries
of gNBs, the userΓÇÖs PDU session, which starts from the user
and ends in the MEC server, should take a handover fromgNB1 to gNB2, incurring signaling costs. The handover delay
also leads to deteriorated user Quality of Experience (QoE).
Furthermore, if the user moves in a large geographical scale
which extends beyond the boundaries of MEC server serving
area, this would results in higher handover signaling costand increased transmission delay. Therefore, the objective of
mobility-aware MEC planning is to determine the serving
areas of each MEC server to minimize the handover costs formobile users.
B. Mobility Management Cost
Then, we quantify the handover management costs in
multiple different levels. In this paper, two types of handover
procedures are considered: the ∩¼ürst one is between gNBs
but within the same MEC serving area, and the second isbetween MEC servers. The ∩¼ürst one is also referred as SSC
mode 1. SSC mode 1 is de∩¼üned in detail in the 3GPP
technical speci∩¼ücation TS 23.502 [32], which comprehensively
de∩¼ünes various procedures within the 5G system. Following
the speci∩¼ücation, we provide a summary of the SSC mode
1 handover procedure between gNBs, as shown in Fig. 2,w i t h
detailed procedures outlined in Chapter 4.9.1.2 of TS 23.502.
This handover process comprises handover preparation,
handover execution, PDU Session modi∩¼ücation, channel cre-
ation and registration procedure. Following these procedures,
the UE PDU Session service undergoes a handover fromthe source-gNB (noted as Source NG-RAN in the ∩¼ügure) to the
target-gNB (Target NG-RAN), controlled by 5G core network
functions including AMF, SMF, and UPF. Consequently, wecalculate the cost c
gfor handovers between gNBs within the
same MEC serving area in SSC mode 1 as follows:

whilst TXnandTUEΓêÆRAN denote the time delays between

Tadmission _control stand for the time consumed by network
functions in decision-making processes. Considering that the
time consumption for these functions is signi∩¼ücantly lower
than the others, we neglect them in the following part.
Then, we also provide an overview of the handover proce-
dure between MEC servers in Fig. 3. The handover between
MEC servers corresponds to SSC mode 2 and mode 3, asde∩¼üned in Chapter 4.3.5.2 of TS 23.502. For improved user
QoE, in this work, we consider that the handover follows
SSC mode 3 due to its lower service interruption delay. Then,as depicted in Fig. 3, this procedure comprises three primary
steps. Initially, SMF1 determines UPF relocation based on the
UEΓÇÖs mobility. Then, SMF2 establishes a new PDU sessionfrom MEC server2 to the UE. Finally, SMF1 releases the
old PDU session from MEC server1 to the UE. Let c

where TN1,TN2,TN3,TN4,TN6,TN7,TN10, and

ing core network functions through these interfaces, and
TUEΓêÆRAN denotes the time delay from access network
interfaces. Additionally, TSMF _Selection ,TPCF _Selection ,
TUPF _Selection , and TTrigger denote the time consumed by
network function decision-making processes. These decision-
making processes are described in detail in clause 4.3.2.2.1 of
TS 23.502. Each decision-making process in cMis a complex
process to make decisions according to the actual situation, so
the decision delay of cMis much larger than cgΓÇÖs.C. Graph-Partitioning Problem Formulation
Let G=(V,E) represents a 5G RAN network graph,
where the set V={vi}corresponds to the 5G gNBs, and the
setE={e(vi,vj)|viΓêêV,vjΓêêV}represents the handover
behaviors between gNBs. Then, the weight of e(vi,vj)is
denoted as wij, which quanti∩¼ües the average number of users
moving from gNB vito gNB vj. Moreover, we consider
the graph Gas an undirected graph, because the handover
behavior is symmetric between two gNBs. We assume thatthere are NgNBs in total, and all gNBs are served by several
MEC Server. The total number of MEC Servers is denoted
asP. Consequently, the entire RAN network should be divided
intoPpartitions, de∩¼üned as S
1,S2,..., SP. Hence, the union
of all partitions is equal to V:Γê¬P
k=1Sk=V, and each gNB
exclusively belongs to one partition: SkΓê⌐S/prime
k=ΓêàΓêÇk,k/prime.
The number of gNBs in partition SkisNk, satisfying/summationtextP
K=1Nk=N.
As de∩¼üned in Section III-B , the handover cost between
gNBs within the same MEC serving area is denoted as cg,
whilst the handover cost between gNBs from different MECserving area is denoted as c
M. Based on the descriptions
provided for each interface in 3GPP TS23.501, it is obvious
thatcM>cg.
We introduce the decision variable xikto show the depen-
dency relationship between gNB viand partition Sk, where
xik=1 means that gNB vibelongs to partition Sk, and
xik=0 indicates the opposite. Our objective is to minimize
user handover costs by optimizing the distribution of MEC
servers under load balancing conditions. Therefore, the objec-tive function is expressed as follows

From Eq. (1)to(3), our optimization objective is to
minimize the sum of user mobility handover cost and network
load balancing, with ╬▒and╬▓are used for balancing the
optimization direction. Eq. (2)represents the variance of the
number of gNBs within different partitions. For the layout
and planning of gNBs, they are deployed to serve users byconsidering the geographical population density. Hence, the
number of gNBs represents the workloads for MEC servers.
In Eq. (3), we split the user handover cost into two parts:
one is the handover cost resulting from movement between
different partitions, and the other is the handover cost resultingfrom movement between gNBs within the same partition.
Furthermore, Constraint (4)ensures that a gNB can only
belong to one partition, and Constraint (5)implies that each
gNB should be assigned to one partition.
In Eq. (3), when c
M>cgis ensured, the partition results
S1,S2,..., SPremain unaffected by the speci∩¼üc values of cM
and cg. Therefore, we set cM=1,cg=0, and simplify
Eq.(3)into the following form. In this case, Edge _cut is

Based on Eq. (2)and (6), the problem of mobility-aware

LGORITHM
In this section, we adapt the GAP framework [12] and
design the MECP-GAP algorithm for mobility-aware MEC
planning. Firstly, we introduce the graph learning-based GAPframework to tackle the Graph Partitioning problem. Then,
the structure of our improved GAP framework is outlined,
and the design of the loss function is described in detail.Subsequently, we develop the MECP-GAP algorithm based
on deep learning to solve the MEC server planning problem.
Finally, the algorithmΓÇÖs complexity is analyzed.
A. Problem De∩¼ünition
In Section III, we formulate the mobility-aware MEC server
planning problem as a Graph Partitioning problem. Many tra-ditional algorithms have been proposed for solving the Graph
Partitioning problem [33]. For instance, the Metis algorithm is
a powerful graph partitioning software package known for its
ef∩¼üciency [22]. Recently, deep learning is also applied in solv-
ing optimization problems. The Graph Partitioning problemis also investigated to be solved through learning methods.
The GAP framework, proposed in [12], utilizes the GNN for
embedding graph nodes features and MLP for partitioningnodes. Comparing to traditional algorithms, the Learning-
based GAP algorithm has made signi∩¼ücant improvements in
optimization objectives and algorithm runtime. We improvedthis framework (noted as I-GAP framework) to adapt it to
solve the above MEC servers planning problem. The I-GAP
partitioning framework is illustrated in Fig. 4.
1) Loss Function: Before introducing the I-GAP frame-
work model, we ∩¼ürst present the modelΓÇÖs loss function. Ourobjective is to obtain the partition result X
n├ùpbased on gNB
features Fn├ùfand adjacency weights Wn├ùn. The partition
result is represented as a n├ùpmatrix Xn├ùp. In this matrix,
the element xik=1indicates that gNB vibelongs to partition
Sk, while xik=0 represents the opposite. Thus, we can
reformulate Eq. (6)as follows

where╬▒and╬▓are used for normalization. They are con∩¼ügured
to ensure that the values of edge cut and load balancing arewithin the same range.
2) I-GAP Framework: The I-GAP model comprises two
main modules: the graph embedding module and the graph
partitioning module. The former focuses on learning nodeembeddings using both graph structure and node features. In
I-GAP, the graphSAGE [34] model is employed to embed
node representations, which emphasizes sampling and aggre-gation. As an inductive learning method, graphSAGE not only
learns the embedding representations of each node in the
graph, but also learns the aggregation function used to sample
and aggregate neighbor nodes to generate new embedding rep-
resentations of node [34]. Unlike other transductive methods
which only perform representations learning on a ∩¼üxed graph,
graphSAGE has good inductive ability and does not need to
know the information of all nodes when implementing graphembedding, which is suitable for large-scale graphs and unseen
graphs [35].
In our I-GAP framework, we replace the adjacency matrix
with the adjacency weight matrix to improve the sampling
process of graphSAGE. Each node sample among its neighbors
to aggregate their representations. This process is shown inEq.(10):
h
k
N(v)ΓåÉAGGREGAT E k/parenleftBig
{hkΓêÆ1
u,ΓêÇuΓêêN(v)}/parenrightBig
,(10)
where hk
N(v)represents the embedded representation of node
vat the current step k.hkΓêÆ1u represents the embedded rep-
resentation of node uat step kΓêÆ1, and N(v) represents
all neighbors of node v. In the original graphSAGE model,
neighbor sampling follows the uniform distribution. This
means nodes take ∩¼üxed samples from their neighbors in a
completely random manner. The process is shown in Eq. (11):
uΓåÉUNIFORM (N(v)). (11)
The improvement of graphSAGE lies in the improvement
of the random sampling process. Speci∩¼ücally, suppose node v
and node uare adjacent, and the edge weight between themiswvu. Then the probability that node uis sampled as the
neighbor of node vis:
P(u|v)=wvu/summationtext
iΓêêN(v)wvi, (12)
where/summationtext
iΓêêN(v)wvirepresents the sum of adjacent edge
weights from node vto all its neighbors. Then in our
graphSAGE model, the sampling process can be described as:
uΓåÉuw i t hp r o b a b i l i t yP (u|v). (13)
As can be seen from Eq. (13), the larger the edge weight
between two nodes, the easier it is sampled and aggregated
together. After graph aggregation, their feature vectors aremore similar, so they are more easily to be divided into the
same partition after graph partitioning module, which is also
consistent with the problem to be solved in this paper.
The graph partitioning module consists of a fully connected
network followed by softmax and is trained to minimize the
loss function Eq. (9). Because the graph partitioning module
actually completes a classi∩¼ücation task. That is, according to
the node embedding representation generated by the graph
embedding module, the gNBs is classi∩¼üed into differentpartitions. As a ∩¼éexible model architecture, fully connected
network can be applied to various classi∩¼ücation problems and
has wide applicability in various scenarios [36].
B. MECP-GAP Algorithm
In this section, the MECP-GAP algorithm is proposed. The
primary steps of this algorithm are outlined in Algorithm 1.
It is emphasized that Algorithm 1operates in parallel
with network training, concurrently producing the networkmodel and partition results. Consequently, the primary factor
in∩¼éuencing the time complexity is the number of training
epoch, denoted as e
1.L e t Nrepresent the number of gNBs. In
the sampling process, as we set a ∩¼üxed number of sampling,
the time complexity of the sampling process is O(1). In the
aggregation process, the mean representation of the neighbornodes needs to be calculated. Assuming that there are n∩¼üxed
samples in the neighbors and the data feature dimension is
m, the upper limit of the time complexity of the aggregation
process is O(nΓêùm). As matrix operations are used in the
actual calculation, the actual complexity will be less than this
value.
In the classi∩¼ücation process, the classi∩¼ücation network needs
to be trained. Speci∩¼ücally, the training epoch is set as e
2,b
represents the number of batches, and the time complexity of
calculating the loss function is related to batch size, denoted
asO(s). We ignore the time which takes to update the
network parameters. So, the time complexity of Algorithm 1
isO(e1(N(1 + nΓêùm)+e2ΓêùbΓêùs)), simpli∩¼ües to O(e1N+
e1Nnm +e1e2bs).
C. Practical Relevance
The proposed MECP-GAP algorithm solves the problem
of MEC server deployment for mobility management. Sincethe MEC server needs suf∩¼ücient hardware support, the MEC
server in our scenario will not move once deployed, which is

also consistent with the reality. First, regarding the adaptability
of the algorithm, based on the generalization ability of
the I-GAP graph neural network framework, the network
parameters obtained by training on a large graph can bedirectly used to partition the new graph (network) to deploy
the MEC server. Therefore, MECP-GAP algorithm has good
adaptability. MECP-GAP can even deal with unseen graphs,so it also has good robustness. Regarding the scalability
of the algorithm, the MEC algorithm is suitable for small-
scale networks (hundreds of gNBs) and large-scale networks(thousands of gNBs). When facing the challenge of hyper-scale
network (millions of gNBs), network operators can manually
split the network into many general scale networks. Thenthe MECP-GAP algorithm is applied to the general scale
networks.
V. S
IMULATION
We conduct intensive simulations to evaluate our proposed
MECP-GAP algorithm. Two sets of simulations are conducted,
the ∩¼ürst is a small scale network simulation to illustrate the
partitioning results more clearly. The second is a large scale
network simulation with real gNBs dataset. Comparing to twowidely used traditional graph partitioning algorithms, MECP-
GAP achieves better partitioning results with lower running
time.
A. Simulation Setting
In the small scale simulation, there are 200 gNBs, and their
geographical locations are generated using a Poisson PointProcess. For the large scale simulation, we utilize the location
coordinates of 2170 gNBs located in Shanghai, China, fromthe of∩¼ücial website of Opencellid [37]. Opencellid is an open-
source platform that provides location coordinates for gNBs
and eNBs across the globe.
The adjacency weight matrix, denoted as W, incorpo-
rates information about both the adjacency relationship and
the number of handovers between gNBs. In our simula-tion, we utilize the human movement model proposed by
Liang et al. [38] to generate the values in W. This model is
capable of estimating the volume of population movementsbetween two regions based on the distance separating those
regions and the sizes of the regions. It is a well-established
human movement model commonly used in sociology, which
enhances the realism of our simulation results. To generate W
in our simulation, we ∩¼ürst create a V oronoi graph based onthe geographical locations of the gNBs. The V oronoi graph
delineates the service areas for each gNB. Subsequently, we
input the gNB location information and the associated areainformation into the human movement model to calculate the
number of handover users moving between gNBs and obtain
the adjacency weight matrix W.
The I-GAP model comprises two primary modules: the
graph embedding module and the graph partitioning module.
In the graph embedding module, we employ the graphSAGEmodel, which is a 2-layer graph convolutional network. It takes
input features with a dimensionality of 200 and outputs embed-
dings of dimensionality 128. The gNBΓÇÖs geographical locationis utilized as its feature for both small scale and large scale
simulations. To aggregate neighboring node representations in
graphSAGE, we employ the mean aggregator. Compared with
LSTM aggregator and pooling aggregator, the mean aggregator
are more suitable for scenarios where the overall informationof neighbor nodes is retained. This method is often used in
tasks such as node classi∩¼ücation and graph partitioning. In
the graph partitioning module, we utilize a fully connectedneural network to transform the 128-dimensional input matrix
into the desired number of partitions. The partition result Xis
obtained using the softmax activation.
B. Baseline Algorithms
The greedy algorithm: in the work of Taleb and
Ksentini [33], they introduced a pseudo-greedy algorithm
to address the graph partitioning problem. This algorithminitiates by randomly selecting a node v
ifrom the node
set to serve as the center of partition Sk. It then iterates
through all neighbors of vi, evaluating whether each neighbor
satis∩¼ües certain constraint conditions. If a neighbor meets these
conditions, it is added to partition Sk. This process continues
until no more nodes can be added to the partition. This
algorithm is a classical approach for graph partitioning, and
its performance typically improves with an increased numberof iterations.
The Metis algorithm [22]: is a widely used graph par-
titioning algorithm known for its high ef∩¼üciency. It servesas a common baseline for graph partitioning algorithms.
This algorithm requires input data regarding node and link
information, as well as the desired number of partitions. It is

capable of swiftly producing partition results, which makes it
a suitable choice for our baseline comparison.
PBPA: in [39], the author focuses on the operation and
dynamic deployment of MEC servers. Based on PPO rein-
forcement learning framework, PBPA algorithm is designedto determine the placement and migration of MEC servers in
dynamic scenarios to minimize operating costs, which is a very
advanced method in MEC server deployment related works.
C. Small Scale Network Simulation
In this section, a small-scale simulation involving 200 gNBs
is conducted, and the speci∩¼üc partition results are shown in
Fig. 5.
Fig. 5(a-e) shows the outcomes of the small scale sim-
ulation, ranging from two partitions to six partitions. Thepartitions are signi∩¼üed by different colored nodes, with blue
lines denoting the boundaries of gNBΓÇÖs serving area created
by the V oronoi graph. The black lines represent the numberof handovers, with thicker lines indicating higher handover
numbers.
In Fig. 5(a), the RAN network is partitioned into two parts
with two colors. It is obvious that the two partitions are
fairly balanced. In the case of more partitions, MECP-GAP
ensures a balanced trade-off between edge cut optimizationand load balancing. In Fig. 5(b), green nodes are added as
a new partition. This outcome stems from MECP-GAPΓÇÖs
inclination towards improving the edge cut in this particularaccess network topology. Fig. 5(c-e) show the partition results
for scenarios involving four to six partitions. The network
operators can judiciously choose the number of partitions for
MEC server deployment, taking into consideration the local
user load and server capacity.
Fig. 6illustrates the convergence behavior of MECP-GAP,
using the six partitions scenario as an example. It becomes
notably stable when the epochΓëê50.F i g . 7presents a com-
parison of the average running times for the three algorithms.
Since PBPA deploying MEC servers only be used on a
∩¼üxed graph. So the algorithm execution and network trainingprocess of PBPA are carried out simultaneously. Its simulation
time is about 242.32s~265.45s. As the time is much longer
than the above three algorithmsΓÇÖ, we did not put it on Fig. 7.
It should be noted that we rely on the runtime performance
of MECP-GAP derived from the trained I-GAP network
model. This approach leverages the inherent generalizationcapabilities of the I-GAP network model. Notably, the MECP-
GAP algorithm consistently maintains a low running time. In
contrast, both the Greedy algorithm and Metis take longer toexecute than MECP-GAP. The running time of the Greedy
algorithm appears to change with the number of partitions,
suggesting that the algorithmΓÇÖs performance may be in∩¼éuenced
by the partition number. Metis, on the other hand, runs the
longest, approximately three times as long as MECP-GAP.
Fig. 8(a-c) illustrate the loss function, edge cut, and
load balancing plots with different number of partitions. In
Fig. 8(a), all the four curves increase as the number of
partitions increases. ItΓÇÖs worth noting that, for the purpose of
demonstrating algorithm performance, we set ╬▒=1/1000 and
Fig. 5. Small scale network partition result from two partitions to six
partitions.
╬▓=1. So the result values of edge cut and load balancing
are in the same order of magnitude. Consequently, the trend
of the curve in Fig. 8(a) is similar to that in Fig. 8(b).

The loss function of MECP-GAP is optimized under each
partition because both of its components are optimal, as
con∩¼ürmed by Fig. 8(b) and Fig. 8(c). Fig. 8(b) shows the
edge cut values, which increase with the growing number of
partitions. Meanwhile, Fig. 8(c) displays the load balancing
results of the three algorithms as they change with the number
of partitions. Notably, the load balancing for the Greedy
algorithm, Metis and PBPA exhibits no ∩¼üxed trend due to theinherent randomness of these two algorithms. However, for
MECP-GAP, the load balancing generally increases from 2 to
53 with the growing number of partitions.
Fig. 9shows how the average handover delay of users
changes over time in the small-scale network. The six par-
titions results generated by four algorithms are deployed tosmall-scale networks. By setting the mobile user to move
linearly between different gNB areas, the simulation time is set
to 80 minutes. The ∩¼ürst ten minutes are the warm-up time. Asthe mobile users are deployed to the network, it begins to move
in the network and across the boundaries of the MEC coverage
area. Then the handover delay of the user to handover betweenthe MEC server coverage areas under different algorithm is
observed. It can be seen that MECP-GAP algorithm is the
smallest in most of the time. It means that in the MEC service
network generated by MECP-GAP, the average handover delay
of users is the lowest. Besides, its ∩¼éuctuation is also the moststable, which shows that the load balancing part of the loss
function works, so that the handover tasks of users are more
balanced. In contrast, Metis and Greedy perform less well. Theaverage handover delay of PBPA is the highest and ∩¼éuctuates
in a wide range.Fig. 8. Small scale optimization objective: (a) loss function, (b) edge cut,
(c) load balancing.
D. Large Scale Network Simulation
In this section, we present the results of the large scale
simulation. Due to the high density of gNBs in the simulation,the speci∩¼üc partition result graph would not be displayed.
Fig. 10illustrates the convergence of the MECP-GAP
algorithm in the large scale simulation. ItΓÇÖs evident that the
algorithm approaches convergence when epoch<50.F i g . 11
displays the average running time of the three algorithms inthe large scale simulation. Metis exhibits a slightly shorter
average running time than MECP-GAP, indicating that Metis
has a time advantage when dealing with large scale networks.The running time of Metis ∩¼éuctuates between 1032 ms and
1104 ms, while MECP-GAP ∩¼éuctuates between 1427 ms and

1540 ms. Specially, the Greedy algorithm runs signi∩¼ücantly
slower than the ∩¼ürst two when handling large scale networks,
taking approximately ten times longer than the others. Thisis due to the high time complexity of greedy algorithms in
the worst-case scenario. Similarly, PBPA only be used on a
∩¼üxed graph when deploying MEC servers. The execution timeof PBPA is in range of 1598.68s~1683.41s, which is much
longer than the previous three algorithms. So it is not marked
in Fig. 11.
Fig. 12(a-c) illustrates the changes in the loss function
and its components for the four algorithms in the large-scalesimulation. In Fig. 12(a), itΓÇÖs evident that MECP-GAPΓÇÖs loss
function remains optimal, roughly

speci∩¼ücally examines the edge cut component. The value forMECP-GAP is slightly lower than MetisΓÇÖs, both of which are
lower than the Greedy algorithm and PBPA. In Fig. 12(c),Fig. 12. Large scale optimization objective: (a) loss function, (b) edge cut,
(c) load balancing.
it becomes apparent that the load balancing achieved by
MECP-GAP is better in each partition compared to the other
algorithms. This indicates that the partitions created by MECP-
GAP are more balanced, making the server less prone tooverload issues.
Fig. 13shows how the average handover delay of the four
algorithms changes over time in a large-scale network. It is
generated in the same way as the small-scale simulation. It is
obvious that MECP-GAP has the best performance in termsof delay value and stability. In contrast, Metis and Greedy
delay values are longer and ∩¼éuctuate in a large range. PBPA
∩¼éuctuates in a large range, and its delay value is the longestin four algorithms. Mobile users have the worst handover
experience in this scenario.

VI. C ONCLUSION
In this work, we investigate the optimum mobility-aware
MEC server planning problem by determining the serving area
of each MEC servers to minimize the handover management
cost for maintaining service continuity and balancing MEC
servers workloads at the same time. The problem is formulated
as a graph partitioning problem to partition the 5G RANgraph with minimum SSC management costs and balanced
MEC servers workloads. Then, we adapt the GAP framework
and propose a MEC server planning algorithm MECP-GAP.Leveraging on deep learning, MECP-GAP achieves better
performance with lower running time by comparing to sev-
eral traditional baselines. For future work, network planningoptimization should be emphasized on more network scenar-
ios, such as the 6G network. And learning based methods can
be applied in dealing with more typical problems.
